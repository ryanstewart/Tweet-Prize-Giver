I'm in the process of learning PHP and this is one of the
first experiments. 

As an evangelist for Adobe, I give away a lot of stuff when I
speak. I wrote this so I can specify a search term and a "start"
time and have it pull all of the tweets after that start time 
with the search term. Then I have it generate a random number 
which selects a specific tweet that will get the prize.
